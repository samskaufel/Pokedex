# Pokedex Simple JS App
# Description
This small web application uses HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and interfaces with an external Pokemon API using AJAX. This app displays a list of 150 Pokemon, and upon user action (i.e., clicking on a Pokemon), the user can view details for that Pokemon.
# Objective
The purpose of creating this web app was to get experience using JS, interacting with DOM, loading data from an API, using a JS library (jQuery), using a UI framework (Bootstrap), and using ESLint rules.
